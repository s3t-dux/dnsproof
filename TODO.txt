# TODO
1. cron job for re-sign a zone file when DNSSEC is enabled.
2. Take care of SERVER_NAME in config.py for DNSSEC
3. Change AGENT_SECRET

# CLI
✅ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements):

Auto-lookup record_id during edit by type + name (as discussed)

Add dnssec rotate, resign, etc.

Add --json output format

CLI command to fetch & dump zone JSON file

Build a package: dnp as installed console command

Let me know when you're ready for any of these — or want the pyproject.toml to register dnp as a global CLI.
